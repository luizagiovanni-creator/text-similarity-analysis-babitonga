# Text Similarity Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to evaluate and analyze the similarity between different texts. It employs various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and algorithms to determine how closely related two pieces of text are.

## Objectives
- To implement algorithms that calculate text similarity.
- To provide tools for users to upload and compare texts.
- To visualize the similarity scores in an intuitive way.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `NLTK` for natural language processing.
  - `Scikit-learn` for machine learning models.
  - `Matplotlib` for data visualization.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these instructions:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luizagiovanni-creator/text-similarity-analysis-babitonga.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd text-similarity-analysis-babitonga
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to upload your texts and get similarity scores.
